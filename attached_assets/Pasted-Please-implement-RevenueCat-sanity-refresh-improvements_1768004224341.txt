Please implement “RevenueCat sanity + refresh” improvements, ONLY IF they are not already implemented.

1) Add DEBUG logging (also in production/TestFlight builds, not only __DEV__), but ONLY if such logs do not already exist:
- initializeRevenueCat(): log platform, whether apiKey exists (true/false only), and configure success/failure.
- fetchCustomerInfo(): log active entitlements keys and whether "Kegel Coach Pro" is active.
- purchase flow success: after purchase, ensure CustomerInfo is refreshed and entitlement status logged.
- restorePurchases() success: after restore, ensure CustomerInfo is refreshed and entitlement status logged.

2) Ensure the app refreshes subscription state immediately after purchase/restore, ONLY IF not already handled globally:
- After a successful purchase or restore, call a shared refreshCustomerInfo() helper that:
  a) calls Purchases.getCustomerInfo()
  b) updates the global subscription state (useAppState or existing store)
  c) returns the fresh CustomerInfo
- Do not duplicate logic if an equivalent refresh already exists.

3) Entitlement check safety:
- If not already implemented, make checkEntitlement() explicitly return:
  Boolean(customerInfo.entitlements.active[entitlementId])
- Add a debug log ONLY when the entitlement is missing.

4) Debug helper (temporary):
- Add a “Debug: Print Subscription Status” button ONLY if no equivalent debug tool exists.
- Button must be guarded by a DEBUG flag and NOT always visible in production UI.
- On press: fetch CustomerInfo and log active entitlements + entitlement result for "Kegel Coach Pro".

5) Environment variable validation:
- During initialization, log whether EXPO_PUBLIC_REVENUECAT_IOS_KEY / ANDROID_KEY are present (true/false only), ONLY if such logging does not already exist.

Do not change any existing behavior if it already fulfills the above.
Do not add duplicate logs or duplicate state updates.

After changes:
- Run TypeScript checks
- Ensure no build errors
- Provide a short summary of what was changed vs. what was already present.
